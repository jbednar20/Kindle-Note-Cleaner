The world was still reeling from the fallout of a Russian cyberattack on Ukraine that less than two years earlier had shut down government agencies, railways, ATMs, gas stations, the postal service, even the radiation monitors at the old Chernobyl nuclear site, before the code seeped out of Ukraine and haphazardly zigzagged its way around the globe.

Putin’s digital army had been messing with Ukraine ever since. Russian hackers made a blood sport of hacking anyone and anything in Ukraine with a digital pulse. For five long years, they shelled Ukrainians with thousands of cyberattacks a day and scanned the country’s networks incessantly for signs of weakness—a weak password, a misplaced zero, pirated and unpatched software, a hastily erected firewall—anything that could be exploited for digital mayhem.

In the first year, 2014, alone, Russian state media and trolls barraged Ukraine’s presidential election with a disinformation campaign that alternately blamed the country’s mass pro-Western uprisings on an illegal coup, a military “junta,” or “deep states” in America and Europe. Hackers stole campaign emails, prowled for voter data, infiltrated Ukraine’s election authority, deleted files, and implanted malware in the country’s election reporting system that would have claimed victory for a far-right fringe candidate. Ukrainians discovered the plot just before the results were reported to Ukraine’s media. Election security experts called it the most brazen attempt to manipulate a national election in history.

The crux of Putin’s foreign policy was to undercut the West’s grip on global affairs. With every hack and disinformation campaign, Putin’s digital army sought to tie Russia’s opponents up in their own politics and distract them from Putin’s real agenda: fracturing support for Western democracy and, ultimately, NATO—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—the only thing holding Putin in check.

For years classified national intelligence estimates considered Russia and China to be America’s most formidable adversaries in the cyber realm. China sucked up most of the oxygen, not so much for its sophistication but simply because its hackers were so prolific at stealing American trade secrets. The former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, famously called Chinese cyberespionage the “greatest transfer of wealth in history.”

Starting in 2016, the U.S. National Security Agency’s own cyber arsenal—the sole reason the United States maintained its offensive advantage in cyberspace—was dribbled out online by a mysterious group whose identity remains unknown to this day. Over a period of nine months a cryptic hacker—or hackers; we still don’t know who the NSA’s torturers are—calling itself the Shadow Brokers started trickling out NSA hacking tools and code for any nation-state, cybercriminal, or terrorist to pick up and use in their own cyber crusades.

On June 27, 2017, Russia fired the NSA’s cyberweapons into Ukraine in what became the most destructive and costly cyberattack in world history. That afternoon Ukrainians woke up to black screens everywhere. They could not take money from ATMs, pay for gas at stations, send or receive mail, pay for a train ticket, buy groceries, get paid, or—perhaps most terrifying of all—monitor radiation levels at Chernobyl.

He’d titled his lecture “Reflections on Trusting Trust,” and his conclusion was this: unless you wrote the source code yourself, you could never be confident that a computer program wasn’t a Trojan horse.

In 1967—nine years before the first email would traverse the internet—a computer pioneer by the name of Willis H. Ware outlined the myriad vulnerabilities in modern computer systems and all the ways they could lead to classified information leaks or be exploited for espionage. His so-called Ware Report proved a catalyst for the Pentagon to convene a Defense Science Board task force to study computer security. That task force came to several ominous conclusions, chief among them: “Contemporary technology cannot provide a secure system in an open environment.”

The Anderson Report concluded that computers provided would-be attackers with a “unique opportunity for attempting to subvert” their systems and access their underlying data. “Coupled with the concentration of the application (data control systems, etc.) in one place” (the computer system), that capability “makes computers a uniquely attractive target for malicious (hostile) action.” The design of hardware and software systems was “totally inadequate to withstand attack,” the report concluded; and if one malicious user could control a single computer node, “the entire network may be compromised.” The only limits to attack were attackers’ own imagination and skill.

Zero-days do not stay secret indefinitely.

Earlier studies determined that the average life-span of a zero-day is ten months.

Regulating the global sale of zero-days has long been a messy and flawed endeavor. Most can agree that restricting the sale of hacking tools to authoritarian regimes is noble in theory. Proponents point out that the State Department regularly blocks weapon sales to dictatorships and argue the same logic should apply to digital tools that can be used to spy on entire populations or trigger a deadly explosion. But critics argue that, in practice, the rules would backfire. Security researchers argue that restrictions on zero-days would actually handicap cybersecurity, in that it would keep researchers from sharing vulnerability research and malware code across borders. American companies that conduct business abroad argue it would open them to select prosecution, and ultimately benefit states like China and Russia that only enforce regulations when convenient. Others argue that zero-days are code and regulating the exchange of code would be akin to regulating math and ideas, infringements on free speech. As the two Italians, Luigi and Donato, put it: “We don’t sell weapons, we sell information.” The pushback has helped keep the zero-day market largely unregulated. And so long as the United States continues to be one of the zero-day market’s biggest sponsors, that is unlikely to change.

The closest the United States has ever gotten to controlling the export of hacking tools and surveillance technology is the Wassenaar Arrangement. Named for the Dutch town where the arrangement was originally signed in 1996, the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies was designed to replace the previous set of Cold War norms used by Western states to keep weapons and military technology from making their way to Russia, China, and their communist satellites. Wassenaar’s goal was to control the sale of conventional weapons systems and dual-use technologies—sophisticated computers, centrifuges, drones—from reaching despots in Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea.

closest the United States ever came was in May 2015, when regulators pushed to incorporate Wassenaar’s changes into law. The Department of Commerce tried to mandate that security researchers and technology companies obtain a license to export “cybersecurity items” like “intrusion software.” But the proposal failed after everyone from the Electronic Frontier Foundation to Google threw a fit. The most vocal critics were companies in the $1.7 billion “penetration testing” industry, where White Hats get paid to hack their clients’ systems with exploits and intrusion tools to harden their defenses. They were terrified that Wassenaar’s overly broad wording would put them out of business and they pushed U.S. regulators to abandon the proposal and to lobby Wassenaar’s members to narrow the scope of the items added to their control list. Eventually their arguments won out: Wassenaar’s language was narrowed to the systems that “command and control” intrusion software. And even then—even after Wassenaar’s member states adopted the limited language into law—the United States, without explanation, never has.

Back in 2011, a whistleblower tipped off the Pentagon that its security software was riddled with Russian backdoors. The Pentagon had paid Computer Sciences Corporation—the same megacontractor that now owns VRL—$613 million to secure its systems. CSC, in turn, subcontracted the actual coding to a Massachusetts outfit called NetCracker Technology, which farmed it out to programmers in Moscow. Why? Greed. The Russians were willing to work for a third of the cost that U.S. programmers had quoted. As a result, the Pentagon’s security software was basically a Russian Trojan horse, inviting in the very adversary the Pentagon had paid hundreds of millions of dollars to keep out.

Flame’s infection mechanism was worse. The Americans, the Israelis, or both together had turned customers’ trust in Microsoft into a weapon of warfare. They had spread Flame through Microsoft’s Windows software update mechanism. What made that so terrifying was that 900 million Microsoft computers got patches and updates that way. Infecting Microsoft’s updates was the Holy Grail for hackers, and a nightmare for Redmond. In any other hands, Flame could have taken down the global economy,

U.S. intel agencies had taken a big hit in morale after Snowden and NSA analysts were leaving in droves. Some compared it to an “epidemic.” Meanwhile, the most capable college graduates weren’t taking jobs at the NSA anymore, especially when they could make far more money working at Google, Apple, or Facebook. It was even harder to recruit defenders to the Department of Homeland Security. It had always been more fun to be a pirate than to join the Coast Guard, and this was putting the United States at a growing disadvantage. The United States doesn’t forcibly conscript talented hackers at Google and MIT to moonlight as nation-state attackers like the Russians, Iranians, North Koreans, and Chinese do. We might still be the world’s most sophisticated cyber power in offense, but the scales were tipping.

Russians took their attacks one step further. That January, CrowdStrike discovered that Russian hackers had successfully compromised industrial control software companies and Trojanized the software updates that made their way into hundreds of industrial control systems across the country. It was the same technique the Americans and Israelis had used five years earlier with Flame, when they infected computers in Iran using Trojanized Microsoft software updates. But the Russians had been far less judicious. It wasn’t just U.S. oil and gas companies anymore; Russian hackers infected the software updates that reached the industrial controllers inside hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, pipelines, and the grid, and were now inside the very computers that could unleash the locks at the dams, trigger an explosion, or shut down power to the grid.

Months before the Shadow Brokers first leaked the NSA’s tools in 2016—and more than one year before North Korea and Russia used them to wreak global havoc—China had discovered the NSA’s exploits on their own systems, snatched them, and used them for their own stealth attacks. It took three years for anyone to sort this out. If the NSA knew China was hacking American allies using its tools, that intelligence never made it into the hallowed halls of the VEP, where deliberators might have seized the opportunity to get the bugs fixed long before the Shadow Brokers, North Korea, or Russia could use them for chaos. Symantec’s discovery was clear evidence that even when the NSA used its tools in stealth, there were no guarantees that our adversaries wouldn’t detect them and—like a gunslinger who grabs an enemy’s rifle and starts firing away—turn them back on us. It was another sign that NOBUS—the presumption that “nobody but us” had the sophistication to find and exploit zero-days—was an arrogant one. Not only that, it was obsolete. The NSA’s advantage had hugely eroded over the last decade—not just because of Snowden and the Shadow Brokers and what had been learned from Stuxnet, but because we had grossly underestimated our enemies. More unsettling was the Chinese hacking group behind the extraction and redeployment of the NSA’s exploits. The group, code-named Legion Amber, was based in Guangzhou, an ancient city in southern China, but even the agency struggled to make sense of their ties to the state. Legion Amber’s “operators appear to be private or contract hackers, but little is known about their affiliation,” one classified NSA assessment concluded. “However, their heavy targeting of Five Eyes and global government and industrial entities suggests they are operating on behalf of elements of the Chinese government.” NSA analysts came to believe that Legion Amber’s members were part of a digital reserve army comprised of China’s top security engineers, who worked for private internet companies by day but were tapped by China’s main spy agency, the Ministry of State Security, for sensitive operations by night. Among Legion Amber’s early targets were U.S. defense contractors. But its hit list expanded over the years to include American weapons developers and scientific research labs, where they stole aerospace, satellite, and—most alarming of all—nuclear propulsion technologies. Symantec could not or would not say what, exactly, the Chinese had used the NSA’s exploits to steal, but based on Legion Amber’s rap sheet, we weren’t talking paint formulas.

Asked whether he would tell Putin not to interfere in 2020, Trump had mock-scolded his buddy. “Don’t meddle in the election, President,” he told Putin, wagging his finger with a smile. As for the journalists doing the questioning that day, “Get rid of them,” Trump told Putin, whose tenure oversaw the murder of dozens of Russian journalists. “Fake news is a great term, isn’t it? You don’t have this problem in Russia, but we do.”

In the four intervening years, the Kremlin only grew more emboldened—albeit stealthier. In 2016 Russia’s influence operation stood out for its brazenness. Social media posts were written in broken English. Facebook ads were paid out in rubles, and self-proclaimed Texas secessionists and Black Lives Matter protesters logged into servers from Red Square. Now Russians were setting up offshore bank accounts, paying real Facebook users to rent their accounts, and obscuring their real locations using Tor, the anonymizing software.

In September 2018 the president ceded decision-making for U.S. offensive cyberattacks to the Pentagon, where those decisions now fell to General Paul M. Nakasone, the new director of the NSA, who also ran Cyber Command. The previous month, the president’s hawkish national security advisor John Bolton had drafted a new cyber strategy giving Cyber Command far more leeway to conduct offensive cyberattacks than they had under Obama, when every attack required express presidential approval. Trump signed the secret, still-classified order known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 in September. And with Cyber Command’s reins loosened and Trump effectively out of the way, the nation’s elite warriors took the fight right back to Russia’s servers.

That October, one month ahead of the midterms, Cyber Command delivered the Kremlin a message. They posted warnings directly to the IRA’s computer screens, threatening the agency’s trolls with indictments and sanctions if they meddled in the elections. It was the digital equivalent of the leaflets American pilots dropped over Japan in 1945, urging evacuation before the coming bombs. On Election Day, Cyber Command took the IRA’s servers offline and kept them there for several days, while election officials certified the vote. We may never know what, if anything, the Russians had planned for that day, but the 2018 midterms proceeded relatively unscathed.

Back in Washington, a nascent cybersecurity agency within the Department of Homeland Security was charged with the most thankless and incongruously controversial job in Washington: protecting the 2020 election. Just after the 2018 midterms, Trump signed into law the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act, elevating a dedicated cybersecurity agency within DHS that would now be known by the acronym CISA. Chris Krebs, a forty-something, former Microsoft executive with a man-boyish charm, was tapped to lead the agency defending an election the president did not want to defend and helping states that did not want his help. It is states, after all, that run U.S. elections. To provide states with any federal election security assistance—even so much as a vulnerability scan—federal agencies must be invited.

By 2019, ransomware attacks were generating billions of dollars for Russian cybercriminals and were becoming more lucrative. Even as cybercriminals raised their ransom demands to unlock victims’ data from three figures to six, to millions of dollars, local officials—and their insurers—calculated it was still cheaper to pay their digital extortionists than to rebuild their systems and data from scratch.

“There’s a pax mafiosa between the Russian regime and its cyber cartels,” is how Tom Kellermann, a Russian cybercrime expert, put it to me as we inched closer to the 2020 election. “Russia’s cybercriminals are treated as a national asset who provide the regime free access to victims of ransomware and financial crime. And in exchange, they get untouchable status. It’s a protection racket and it works both ways.”

Officials furnished no proof. But that fall, as ransomware attacks took down one American town after another, they came to fear the ransom elements were smokescreens for deeper probes of counties that might make for ideal targets closer to the 2020 election.

The week of Louisiana’s governor election, cybercriminals held Louisiana’s secretary of state’s office hostage in a ransomware attack that would have upended the election had local officials not had the foresight to separate Louisiana’s voter rolls from their broader network. Louisiana’s election proceeded unscathed, but forensics revealed just how premeditated attackers had been. Timestamps showed that Louisiana’s assailants had breached its systems three months earlier but patiently waited to time their attack for the election. It was, the FBI feared, a preview for 2020.

With each new campaign, it got harder to pinpoint where exactly American-made disinformation ended and Russia’s active measures began. We had become Putin’s “useful idiots.” And so long as Americans were tangled up in our own infighting, Putin could maneuver the world unchecked.

“The mantra of Russian active measures is this: ‘Win through force of politics rather than the politics of force,’ ” is how Clint Watts, a former FBI agent who specializes in Russian disinformation, explained it to me. “What that means is go into your adversary and tie them up in politics to the point where they are in such disarray that you are free to do what you will.”

On their own, none of these attacks mounted to much. But taken together, they fed into what CISA’s Krebs and cybersecurity executives in Silicon Valley dubbed a “perception hack”: smaller attacks, perhaps concentrated in battleground states, that could be easily amplified into something bigger and seized upon as evidence that the whole election is “rigged,” as the president continued to claim, ad nauseum, it would be. At CISA, Krebs’ team set up a “rumor control” site to debunk conspiracy theories and exaggerated claims of election fraud. It put them squarely in the president’s crosshairs. Krebs and his deputies accepted that they would likely get fired for it—just as soon as the election concluded.

Perhaps, very soon, we will learn that Iranian and Russian trolls are bouncing the president’s messages around social media echo chambers. But even if they are, they are getting drowned out by real Americans. If the goal of Putin’s 2016 interference was to sow chaos and undermine democracy, then what is now playing out is beyond his wildest dreams.

My source had gotten his hands on an urgent DHS-FBI alert. It was meant solely for the utilities, the water suppliers, the nuclear plants. The bureaucrats were trying to bury it on a holiday weekend. And as soon as I got eyes on it, I could see why: the Russians were inside our nuclear plants. The report didn’t spell it out. But buried in its technical indicators, analysts had included a snippet of code from one of the attacks. The code made clear that Russia’s hackers had breached the most alarming target of all: Wolf Creek, the 1200-megawatt nuclear power plant near Burlington, Kansas. This was no espionage attack. The Russians were mapping out the plant’s networks for a future attack; they had already compromised the industrial engineers who maintain direct access to the reactor controls and radiation monitors that could affect the kind of nuclear meltdowns the world had only witnessed in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima. This was Stuxnet. Only it wasn’t the United States doing the hacking. It was Russia. And the goal wasn’t to stop the boom. It was to trigger one.

Eight months later, even the Kremlin was surprised when their man was voted into the Oval Office. But instead of causing them to back off, Trump’s election only emboldened them. Under his watch, Russia invisibly worked their way into an untold number of nuclear and power plants around the country.

The truth is, I do not know if or when we will see the kind of cyber-enabled boom I have been warned about for years. But the analogy to Pearl Harbor is a deeply flawed one. America didn’t see that attack coming; we’ve seen the cyber equivalent coming for a decade. What we are experiencing instead is not one attack but a plague, invisible to the naked eye, that ripples across our country at an extraordinary rate, reaching ever deeper into our infrastructure, our democracy, our elections, our freedom, our privacy, and our psyche, with no end in sight. American computers are attacked every thirty-nine seconds. Only when there are highly visible mishaps do we pause for reflection.

But the lessons from even the most destructive attacks tend to be forgotten too quickly. We have normalized them, even as the stakes grow higher, as the threats mutate into ever deadlier versions, as they hit us quicker than ever before. These unfolding crises play out in a dimension few of us can see, in a language few understand, and they are shutting down our cities, towns, and hospitals almost every other day.

Occasionally we respond with indictments or sanctions, and, increasingly, escalating cyberattacks of our own. We too have forgotten that the internet is borderless. There are no red lines. We are not immune from our own attacks. The enemy is indeed a very good teacher. The cyberarms market is no longer ours to monopolize. We can no longer keep our cyberweapons safe. They can, and have, been turned on us. The vulnerabilities are ours, too. We just have more of them

It was only a matter of time before a patient adversary exploited them against us. And now it was all happening, so frequently in fact that most attacks never even made the headlines. They were hitting our nuclear plants, our hospitals, nursing homes, our brightest research labs and companies, and somehow, no matter how much I wrote, this all seemed to escape the consciousness of the average American, of the people now plugging in their Nests, Alexas, thermostats, baby monitors, pacemakers, lightbulbs, cars, stoves, and insulin pumps to the internet.

It was so easy to forget that it was only forty years ago that humans dispatched the first message over the internet. I imagined what the internet would look like in another ten years, then twenty. I thought about how much more dependent we will have become on this web, how much more of our infrastructure will have moved online. And then, for one moment, I allowed my thoughts to drift to the potential for information mayhem and mass destruction.
